\title{Red wine quality dataset of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine}
\format{
A data frame with 1599 rows, quality score, and 11 variables of physicochemical properties of wines.
\itemize{
  \item \code{quality} Tasting preference is a rating score provided by a minimum of three sensory with ordinal values from
  0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). The final sensory score is the median of these evaluations.

  \item \code{fixed.acidity} The fixed acidity is the physicochemical property in unit (g(tartaric acid)/dm^3).
  \item \code{volatile.acidity} The volatile acidity is in unit g(acetic acid)/dm^3.
  \item \code{citric.acid} The citric acidity is in unit g/dm^3.
  \item \code{residual.sugar} The residual sugar is in unit g/dm^3.
  \item \code{chlorides} The chlorides is in unit g(sodium chloride)/dm^3.
  \item \code{free.sulfur.dioxide} The free sulfur dioxide is in unit mg/dm^3.
  \item \code{total.sulfur.dioxide} The total sulfur dioxide is in unit mg/dm^3.
  \item \code{density} The density is in unit g/cm^3.
  \item \code{pH} The wine's pH value.
  \item \code{sulphates} The sulphates is in unit g(potassium sulphate)/dm^3.
  \item \code{alcohol} The alcohol is in unit \% vol.
