\title{A function to calculate the surrogate R-squared measure.}
\usage{
surr_rsq(model, full_model, avg.num = 30, asym = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A reduced model that needs to be investigated. The reported surrogate R-squared is for this reduced model.}

\item{full_model}{A full model that contains all of the predictors in the data set. This model object
should also contain the dataset for fitting the full model and the reduced model in the first argument.}

\item{avg.num}{The number of replication for the averaging of surrogate R-squared.}

\item{asym}{A logical argument whether use the asymptotic version of our surrogate R-squared.
More details are in the paper Liu et al. (2023).}

\item{...}{Additional optional arguments.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"surr_rsq"} is a list containing the following components:
\item{\code{surr_rsq}}{the surrogate R-squared value;}
\item{\code{reduced_model}}{the reduced model under investigation. It should be a subset
of the full model;}
\item{\code{full_model}}{the full model used for generating the surrogate response. It should
have passed initial variable screening and model diagnostics (see Paper for reference);}
\item{\code{data}}{the dataset contains the response variable and all the predictors.}
}
\description{
It can provide the surrogate R-squared for a user specified model.
This function will generate an S3 object of surrogate R-squared measure that will
be called from other functions of this package. The generic S3 function \code{print}
is also developed to present the surrogate R-squared measure.

citric.acid+ residual.sugar + chlorides + free.sulfur.dioxide +
total.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol)

full_mod <- polr(formula = full_formula,
data=RedWine, method  = "probit")

citric.acid - residual.sugar - density")

                               data = RedWine, avg.num = 30)
